1.The project, "Call Center Data Cleaning and Analysis with MySQL," begins by creating a MySQL database named "MYSQL_PROJECT" and defining a structured table to store call center data.

2.The data is loaded into the database using a table data import wizard, with careful handling of errors related to data types.

3.Data analysis includes exploring distinct values and counts in columns like sentiment, reason, channel, response time, and call center, offering insights into call center operations.

4.Aggregations provide key statistics such as minimum and maximum CSAT scores, average call duration, and time-based analysis of call volumes.

5.The project employs window functions to identify the maximum call duration for each state, facilitating a deeper understanding of performance metrics within the call center.
